## Cognitive psychology meets art: exploring creativity, language, and emotion through live musical improvisation in film and theatre

There are two core problem-solving modes: long-term deliberate methodical vs. short-term spontaneous

six universal human emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise)

### Introduction

ASI: artificial *super*intelligence

**1.1 Models of creativity: what behavioral and brain-imaging studies reveal**

This call for investigation came right as the cognitive (and computer) revolution began to respond to the dominant behavioristic approach of scientific psychology and its theories about stimulus-response associations with arguments for the existence of mental representations to fully characterize the complexity of human behavior.

​	**1.1.1 Divergent production**

​	If creativity is characterized by the novelty of a solution to a problem, then one way to study the emergence of creative solutions is to test problem-solving tasks that identify an array of possible solutions. This assumption originates from the claim that creativity is fundamentally measurable in terms of divergent production, or the quantification of varied outcomes, independent of their usefulness, in response to specific stimuli.

## On impact and evaluation in Computational Creativity: A discussion of the Turing Test and an alternative proposal

We show that the versions proposed thus far lack the important aspect of interaction, without which much of the power of the Turing Test is lost. 



### **1 The Turing Test and Computational Creativity**

There are three main motivations for the study of Computational Creativity:

- to provide a computational perspective on human creativity, in order to help us to understand it (cognitive science);
- to enable machines to be creative, in order to enhance our lives in some way (engineering); and
- to produce tools which enhance human creativity (aids for creative individuals)

Creativity can be subdivided into everyday problem-solving, and the sort of creativity reserved for the truly great. These are respectively known as “little-c” (mundane) and “big-C” (eminent) creativity [2]

There are two notions of evaluation in CC: (i) judgements which determine whether an idea or artefact is valuable or not (an essential criterion for creativity) – these judgements may be made internally by whoever produced the idea, or externally, by someone else and (ii) judgements to determine whether a system is acting creatively or not. 

### **2 Attempts to evaluate Computational Creativity using the Turing Test or versions of it**

#### **2.1 Discrimination tests**

#### **2.2 A Turing Test for artistic creativity**

“I will take it that for an ‘artistic’ program to pass the TT would be for it to produce artwork which was:

1. indistinguishable from one produced by a human being; and/or
2. was seen as having as much aesthetic value as one produced by a human being.” 

#### 2.3 Using human creative behaviour as a guide for evaluating Computational Creativity

Wiggins proposes the following working definition of Computational Creativity: “The performance of tasks [by a computer] which, if performed by a human, would be deemed creative.” 

#### 2.4 The importance of interaction

In the spirit of much of the best science of our century, the Turing Test blurs the supposedly sharp line between probing of behavior and probing of mechanisms, as well as the supposedly sharp line between “direct” and “indirect” observation, and thus reminds us of the artificiality of such distinctions. Any computer model of mind that passes a truly deep Turing Test- one that probes for the fundamental mechanisms of thought will agree with “brain structures” all the way down to the level where the essence of thinking really takes place.

### 3 Arguments that the Turing Test is inappropriate for measuring creativity in computers (or humans)

Attempts to pass the Turing Test may result in losing differing, and valuable, styles of creativity (§3.1); 

might fail to take into account the importance of background and contextual information for a creative act (§3.2); 

encourage superficial, uninteresting advances in front-ends (§3.3); 

and result in rewarding creativity which adheres to a certain style over that which creates something which is genuinely novel (§3.4). 

We suggest that although there may be some place for Turing-style tests for Computational Creativity at some point in the future, it is currently impractical (§3.5).

#### 3.1 The Turing Test penalises different styles of creativity

it would be absurd to suggest that a member of one group is less creative than a member of another simply on the grounds that we can distinguish which category they fall into.

Negrotti [23] suggests that instead of continuing to judge the computer’s capabilities directly against those of the human mind, the potentials of the computer as an ‘alternative intelligence’ can be explored. 

#### 3.2 The Turing Test cannot take framing information into account

#### 3.3 The Turing Test rewards ‘window dressing’ and trickery

#### 3.4 The Turing Test encourages pastiche

#### 3.5 The Turing Test is simply too hard

### 4 Alternative suggestions: Two descriptive models

#### 4.1 The FACE model

The FACE model assumes eight kinds of generative acts, which produce the following kinds of results:

- F^p : a method for generating framing information

- F^g : an item of framing information
- A^p: a method for generating aesthetic measures
- A^g : an aesthetic measure
- C^p: a method for generating concepts
- C^g : a concept
- E^p: a method for generating expressions of a concept
- E^g : an expression of a concep

#### 4.2 The IDEA model

We simplify matters by assuming an (I)terative (D)evelopment (E)xecution (A)ppreciation cycle within which software is engineered and its behaviour is exposed to an audience.
