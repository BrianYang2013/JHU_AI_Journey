# Notes

Surprising fact

- Q: Isn’t there a solid definition of intelligence that doesn’t depend on relating it to human intelligence?
- A. Not yet. The problem is that we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent. We understand some of the mechanisms of intelligence and not others.
- The cognitive sciences still have not succeeded in determining exactly what the human abilities are.

# Concept

Intelligence

- Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. Varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people, many animals and some machines.
- **Intelligence** has been defined in many ways: the capacity for [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction), [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic), [understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding), [self-awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness), [learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning), [emotional knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_knowledge), [reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason), [planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning), [creativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity), [critical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking), and [problem-solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-solving). It can be described as the ability to perceive or infer [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information); and to retain it as [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) to be applied to adaptive behaviors within an environment or context.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence#cite_note-1)
- Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. 
- Intelligence involves mechanisms
- Arthur R. Jensen suggests “as a heuristic hypothesis” that all normal humans have the same intellectual mechanisms and that differences in intelligence are related to “quantitative biochemical and physiological conditions”. I see them as speed, short term memory, and the ability to form accurate and retrievable long term memories => How about environment, training method,
