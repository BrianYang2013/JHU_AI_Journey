## Sole et al_2019 - Liquid brains, solid brains

Cognitive networks have evolved a broad range of solutions to the problem of gathering, storing and responding to information. 

 ‘solid’ networks: with a well-defined and physically persistent architecture. 

 ‘liquid’ brains: lack stable connections and static elements. E,g: ant and termite colonies, immune systems and some microbiomes and slime moulds.

cognition and the networks sustaining it became a major enabler of multicellularity.  the appearance and rapid expansion of neural components facilitated new complex behaviours.

The moving hypothesis posits that active exploration of an organism’s spatial environment was a key step in the evolutionary trajectory that produced brains. From this viewpoint, prediction is both a cause and a consequence of animal movement, and its implementation required learning networks to emerge

We identified two key dimensions to characterize different categories of cognitive networks (figure 1): the physical characteristics of the system, and the presence or absence of neurons:

- Solid, Neural: brain, planarians, flatworms, Silico units
- Solid, aneural: Placozoans, roots, stomata in leaves, 
- Liquid, neural: ant or termite societies, robot swarms
- Liquid, aneural: Physarum, immune networks, microbiome communities

brainless systems can under the right conditions learn from experience to discriminate diverse sources of information.

solving a least-action problem

Two key properties shared by most connectionist models: 

1. The interactions between the variables at any given time are explicitly constrained to a finite list of connections. 
2. The connections can change, in that their strength and/or pattern of connectivity can change with time.

## Roth & Dicke_2005 - Evolution of the brain and intelligence

Brain properties assumed to be relevant for intelligence are the (absolute or relative) size of the brain, cortex, prefrontal cortex and degree of encephalization. However, factors that correlate better with intelligence are the number of cortical neurons and conduction velocity, as the basis for information-processing capacity. 

theory of mind, imitation and syntactical language. 

Topics

- How can we define and measure animal intelligence?
  - Intelligence may be defined and measured by the speed and success of how animals, including humans, solve problems to survive in their natural and social environments. 
    - for example, problems related to feeding, spatial orientation, social relationships and intraspecific communication. 
    - behavioral ecologists have proposed that intelligence is nothing but an aggregate of special abilities that evolved in response to specific environments. 
    - Comparative psychologists : we can test animals for general problem solving and associative-learning abilities.
      This should be done with ‘unnatural’ tasks in ‘arbitrary environments’, that is, using laboratory tests. => problems in an ‘unfair’ manner
    - mental or behavioral flexibility is a good measure of intelligence. This can be studied either in the laboratory by measuring changes of tactics in problem solving or by observing ‘innovation rates’ in the wild. 
- What differences in intelligence are supposed to exist among animals and between animals and humans?
  - Neural correlates of intelligence
    - Absolute size, relative brain size, 
    - As body size increases, brain size increases in a negatively allometric way following a power function with an exponent of 0.6–0.8.  The relationship between relative brain size and intelligence is therefore inconclusive. 
    - Another much-discussed general factor is encephalization. This is expressed by an ‘encephalization quotient’. The human brain is 7–8 times larger than expected.
    - human cortical volume is considerably exceeded by that of the elephants and large cetaceans, both in absolute and relative terms. 
    - humans have the largest number of cortical neurons, the higher conduction velocity and smaller distances between neurons, the human cortex probably has the greatest IPC. 
- When we relate differences in intelligence to brain properties, which properties should we look for? 
  - causal understanding of mechanisms of tool use, tool-making, syntactical–grammatical language, consciousness, self-awareness, imitation, deception and theory of mind. 
  - The prevalent view is that **imitation** is found only in humans, and that non-human primates exhibit ‘stimulus enhancement’ and ‘emulation’ rather than true imitation. 
  - theory of mind (**ToM**), that is, the ability to understand another individual’s mental state and take it into account in one’s own behavior
  - **Syntactical–grammatical language**: Most authors agree that sentences consisting of up to three words can be understood and used by chimpanzees, gorillas and dolphins. 
- Are differences, especially those between humans and other mammals, quantitative or qualitative in nature?
  - Of the more general brain features discussed here, number of cortical neurons combined with a high conduction velocity of cortical fibers correlates best with intelligence.
  - An increase in ‘information processing capacity’ is of high importance for intelligence. However, structural and functional specializations in the human prefrontal cortex might also have played an important role. 
  - As birds generally have much smaller cells than mammals [64], this, combined with higher packing density, could result in a much higher number of **pallial/cortical neurons** in corvids compared with mammals with the same brain or cortex size. 
  - It remains open whether humans have truly unique cognitive properties.
  - The outstanding intelligence of humans results not so much from qualitative differences, but from a combination and improvement of these abilities. 
  - ... a combination of an ability for temporal analysis with motor behavior, action planning, thinking and language is evident [18]. In this way, a number of quantitative changes could lead to events that look like ‘jumps’ in the evolution of brains and intelligence.

## Gupta et al 2021_Embodied intelligence via learning and evolution

Deep Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL): a computational framework which can evolve diverse agent morphologies to learn challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks in complex environments.

- First, **environmental complexity** fosters the evolution of morphological intelligence as quantified by the ability of a
  morphology to facilitate the learning of novel tasks. 
- Second, we demonstrate a morphological Baldwin effect i.e., in our simulations evolution rapidly selects morphologies that **learn faster**, thereby enabling behaviors learned late in the lifetime of early ancestors to be expressed early in the descendants lifetime. 
- Third, we suggest a mechanistic basis for the above relationships through the evolution of morphologies that are more **physically stable and energy efficient**, and can therefore facilitate learning and control.

Indeed the field of embodied cognition posits that intelligent behaviors can be rapidly learned by agents whose morphologies are well adapted to their environment.
