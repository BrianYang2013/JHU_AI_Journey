# About this course

Textbook: [Advanced Engineering Mathematics, 10th Edition, by Erwin Kreyszig](http://webpages.iust.ac.ir/jazbi/books/10Edition-ErwinKreyszig-AdvancedEngineeringMathematics.pdf)

This course mainly covers Linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and complex analysis.
Better to warm up with calculus 1 and 2.

It will be the most challenging course for me due to various reasons such as mathematic terminology, different education system, especially to the fact that I haven't work on my math for so many years. As long as I can conquer this one, I should be able to handle all of the rest. Meanwhile, never underestimate the difficulty of the top school.

# About this repo

I plan to publish my notes and exercise here. It might not worth it to finish all of the problem sets for the sake of time, but I will try my best and at least scan through them. Especially for the linear algebra problem sets, I plan to finish most of them. This repo will not include the quiz and exam since they belong to the school.

Plan to reduce the mistakes by:

* Cross-check with my classmates,  
* Check the odd-number answers in the textbook appendix,
* Double-check if I get enough time

I will be delighted to receive suggestions and feedback to improve them and eventually benefit others. So if you have any suggestions, please do let me know. Thanks.

# Typo and error in textbook

* Chapter 7
  
  * 7-2: 11, 15, 29
  * 7-3: 19
  * 7-7: 3 (Example 2 but not theorem 2)
  * 7.9: 10. First column is 3x1, can not multiply with 3x1 vector. if the elements multiply with the vector elements accordingly, then rank=5.

* Chapter 8
  
  * 8.2 - 7, the answer forget to work out the limit.
  * 8.2 - 15: I got a different result. Need to cross-check
  * 8.3 - 1: Answer is wrong
  * 8.4 - 1: A typo in the question. The second A lacks a hat. For the answer, I would simplify it to [-1, 2]^T. Not a mistake.

* Chapter 9
  
  * 9.1 - 11-18: Typo, b=[-4, 6, 0]
  * 9.1 - 34-35: Seem by default the angle is 45.
  * 9.2 - 17-20: Typo
  * 9.2 - 35: Diamond.
  * 9.3 - 27
  * 9.3 - 31
  * 9.5 - 24-28: in question, unit tangent vector should be u(t)
  * 9.5 - 31: |a|, because a might be negative.

* Chapter 9 - Starting from now i don't plan to do all the exercise.
  
  * 9,8 - 1, typo in the question
  * 9.9 - 15, curl v is 0

* Chapter 10 -
  
  * P421: I = f(1, -1, 7) - f(0, 1, 2) = 1-7 - (0+2) = -8
  * 10.2 - 13, independent, answer missed -1.
  * 10.3 P426: ... at almost every point ... : Consider a rectangle, 50% of the tangent are infinity. How we explain this?
  * 10.5 - 9: F=$[e^y/x, e^y\ lnx +2x]$, this is the worst typo I have ever met, wasted me many hours.
  * 10.7, ﻿P456 typo: S: r=[2cosvcosu, 2cosvsinu, **2sinv**]
  * 10.8, P460 typo: ... in some domain D **in** space.

# Watch out

* **Always check your result**
* Check Matrix Size
* Basic arithmetic calculation. Write them down.
* Careful on the terminology. E.g: Solution sets means 0, 1, or infinity. It does not mean a basis set. or a solution.
* **Think from the new view**. Linear Algebra deal with a GROUP of equations, instead on individual.

* “The advancement and perfection of mathematics are intimately connected with the prosperity of the State.”  — Napoleon
* “Besides language and music, mathematics is one of the primary manifestations of the free creative power of the human mind.” — Hermann Weyl
* “Do not worry too much about your difficulties in mathematics, I can assure you that mine are still greater.” — Albert Einstein

* "Mathematics is not a spectator sport. " — George Polya
* True pleasure lies not in the discovery of truth, but in the search for it." — Tolstoy

# Notes

It is good to practice LaTex, but it is time-consuming. From chapter 8, I will focus on understanding and exercise. I may turn them into LaTex if I have time. Update: GoodNotes5 is a better option, save my time.

2021-06-05 W1 Reflect:

* Professor: calculator calculates, human think. I plan to use tools instead of pen and paper after Chapter 8 or 9. It worth carefully think about the education philosophy difference and max out the benefit.
* Put the limited time on the most valuable things. => Reduce exercise, more reading, and coding.
* Scalable: Share Note (mindmap + caution + important theorem + application?)
* I should practice how to turn math into code. Explore [scipy.linalg turtorial](https://github.com/BrianYang2013/JHU_AI_Journey/blob/main/50%20-%20Coding/EN%20625.250%20-%20Linear%20Algeba.ipynb)

2021-06-12 W2 Reflect:

* Chapter 7, Problem set 7.7, Problem 20: Linear Algebra focus on a GROUP of equations, but not a particular equation.
* Chapter 7: solution (basis) lives in the null space. The number of basis means dimension of the null space.
* Chapter 7: KCL: just simply think from the loop perspective. Identify the current direction.
* Maybe I should allow a few empty box in the github contribution. Busy day with full of meetings happens. I should not bother by those little green boxes. If you really want a full year green, write a program and submit empty content every day.  

2021-06-19 W3 Reflect:

* I made quit a few mistakes in Quiz 1, and it is good to best leverage the exam time to do a few more round checks.
* Shopping tomorrow, and camping at the weekend. Happy father's day!
* Reflect might same as rotation for a vector, but not for a curve or a 3-D object.

2021-06-26 W4 Reflect:

* June: 80+ hours screen time on GoodNotes. Need be more efficient, score 95 means OK, 99-100 also means a little bit waste time. Plan on coding, and focus on delivery.
* Very rare to use the physical books

2021-07-01 W5 Reflect:

* Keep swimming. Sorry Hawaii, I will visit you next time.
* Based on my performance of Linear Algebra, Professor accepted my scripts (although different course name) and acknowledge that I have picked up this topic. Applying waive.

2021-07-08 W6 Reflect:

* Quiz 4 part B is not easy. I wasted too much time on T/F questions until I reached to the calculation part. I thought it is similar as the previous 3 weekly tests. Barely finished them in 2 hours, cross my fingers.
* As a result, screen time increased: June 27-July 4, 14 hours. July 5-11 23 hours.

2021-07-15 W7 Reflect:

* Lucky on the Quiz 4, good result. One major mistake on the Part B Q2: I should calculate from Y direction but not X. And careful on the book keeping. 
* It might worth to list down all the key concepts, equation, examples in calculus 3 before the mid-term exam. I think I might lost a little bit now, and I am not fully confidence to integrate or even connect all of those knowledge points under time pressure. Need to wrap them up.  
* The root cause is, 
  * Too many concepts within short time period. Flooded and confused. 
  * I am not really going through the proof part of Stoke's theorem. Need to think and digest those formulas, understand the motivation, how we get them, and the connection. 
  * More practice.
