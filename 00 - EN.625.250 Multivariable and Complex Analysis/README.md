# About this course
Textbook: [Advanced Engineering Mathematics, 10th Edition, by Erwin Kreyszig](http://webpages.iust.ac.ir/jazbi/books/10Edition-ErwinKreyszig-AdvancedEngineeringMathematics.pdf)

This course mainly covers Linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and complex analysis.
Better to warm up with calculus 1 and 2.

This will be the most challenging course for me due to language, terminology, education system, and lack of mathematic training in the past 20 years. As long as I can conquer this one, I can handle all of the rest. Never underestimate the top school.

# About this repo
I plan to publish my solutions and exercise here. It might not worth it to finish all of the problem sets, but I will try to resolve as much as possible and at least scan through all of them. This repo will not include the quiz and exam since they belong to the school.

Plan to reduce the mistakes by:
* Cross-check with my classmates,  
* Check the odd-number answers in the textbook appendix,
* Double-check if I get enough time

I will be delighted to receive suggestions and feedback to improve them and eventually benefit others. So if you have any suggestions, please do let me know. Thanks.

## Notes
It is good to practice LaTex, but it is time-consuming. From chapter 8, I will focus on understanding and exercise. I may turn them into LaTex if I have time. Update: GoodNotes5 is a better option, save my time.

2021-06-05 W1 Reflect:
* Professor: calculator calculates, human think. I plan to use tools instead of pen and paper after Chapter 8 or 9. It worth carefully think about the education philosophy difference and max out the benefit.
* Put the limited time on the most valuable things. => Reduce exercise, more reading, and coding.
* Scalable: Share Note (mindmap + caution + important theorem + application?)
* I should practice how to turn math into code. Explore [scipy.linalg turtorial](https://github.com/BrianYang2013/JHU_AI_Journey/blob/main/50%20-%20Coding/EN%20625.250%20-%20Linear%20Algeba.ipynb)

2021-06- W2 Reflect:
* Chapter 7, Problem set 7.7, Problem 20: Algebra perspective or group of equations, but not individual equation.
