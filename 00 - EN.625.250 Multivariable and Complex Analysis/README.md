# About this repo
I plan to publish my solutions and exercise here. It will not include the quiz and exam since they belong to the school.

Plan to reduce the mistakes by:
* Cross-check the result with my classmates,  
* Check the odd-number answers in the textbook appendix,
* Double-check if I get enough time to avoid silly mistakes,

I will be very happy to receive suggestions and feedback to improve the solutions.

# About this course
This course mainly covers Linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and complex analysis.
Better to warm up with calculus 1 and 2.

Textbook: [Advanced Engineering Mathematics, 10th Edition, by Erwin Kreyszig](http://webpages.iust.ac.ir/jazbi/books/10Edition-ErwinKreyszig-AdvancedEngineeringMathematics.pdf)

This will be the most difficult course for me, due to language, terminology, education system, and lack of the mathematic training in the past 20 years. As long as I can conquer this one, I think I should be able to handle all of the rest. Never underestimate the top school.

* I haven't try them, but I would assume they are good for Calculus warm up.

* [Khan: Multivariable calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus). It is not easy to get 100%, and I don't have time to finish all of them.
