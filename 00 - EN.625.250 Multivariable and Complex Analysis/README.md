# About this course
Textbook: [Advanced Engineering Mathematics, 10th Edition, by Erwin Kreyszig](http://webpages.iust.ac.ir/jazbi/books/10Edition-ErwinKreyszig-AdvancedEngineeringMathematics.pdf)

This course mainly covers Linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and complex analysis.
Better to warm up with calculus 1 and 2.

This will be the most difficult course for me, due to language, terminology, education system, and lack of the mathematic training in the past 20 years. As long as I can conquer this one, I think I should be able to handle all of the rest. Never underestimate the top school.

# About this repo
I plan to publish my solutions and exercise here. It might not worth to finish all of the problem sets, but I will try to resolve as much as possible, and at least scan through all of them. This repo will not include the quiz and exam since they belong to the school.

Plan to reduce the mistakes by:
* Cross-check with my classmates,  
* Check the odd-number answers in the textbook appendix,
* Double-check if I get enough time

I will be delighted to receive suggestions and feedback to improve them and eventually benefit others. If you have any suggestions, please do let me know. Thanks.

## Notes
It is good to practice LaTex but it is time consuming. From chapter 8, I will focus on understandidng and exercise. May turn them into LaTex if I have time. => GoodNotes5 is a better option.

2021-06-03: Professor is right, calculator calculates, human think. I will use tools instead of pen and paper from now on. Carefully think about the education philosophy change, and max out the benefit.

2021-06-05 W1 Reflect:
* Put your limited time in the most valueable things. => Reduce exercise, more reading and coding.
* Scalable: Share Note (mindmap + caution + important theorem + application?)
