# About this course
Textbook: [Advanced Engineering Mathematics, 10th Edition, by Erwin Kreyszig](http://webpages.iust.ac.ir/jazbi/books/10Edition-ErwinKreyszig-AdvancedEngineeringMathematics.pdf)

This course mainly covers Linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and complex analysis.
Better to warm up with calculus 1 and 2.

This will be the most challenging course for me due to language, terminology, education system, and lack of mathematic training in the past 20 years. As long as I can conquer this one, I can handle all of the rest. Never underestimate the top school.

# About this repo
I plan to publish my solutions and exercise here. It might not worth it to finish all of the problem sets, but I will try to resolve as much as possible and at least scan through all of them. This repo will not include the quiz and exam since they belong to the school.

Plan to reduce the mistakes by:
* Cross-check with my classmates,  
* Check the odd-number answers in the textbook appendix,
* Double-check if I get enough time

I will be delighted to receive suggestions and feedback to improve them and eventually benefit others. So if you have any suggestions, please do let me know. Thanks.

# Notes
It is good to practice LaTex, but it is time-consuming. From chapter 8, I will focus on understanding and exercise. I may turn them into LaTex if I have time. Update: GoodNotes5 is a better option, save my time.

2021-06-05 W1 Reflect:
* Professor: calculator calculates, human think. I plan to use tools instead of pen and paper after Chapter 8 or 9. It worth carefully think about the education philosophy difference and max out the benefit.
* Put the limited time on the most valuable things. => Reduce exercise, more reading, and coding.
* Scalable: Share Note (mindmap + caution + important theorem + application?)
* I should practice how to turn math into code. Explore [scipy.linalg turtorial](https://github.com/BrianYang2013/JHU_AI_Journey/blob/main/50%20-%20Coding/EN%20625.250%20-%20Linear%20Algeba.ipynb)

2021-06-12 W2 Reflect:
* Chapter 7, Problem set 7.7, Problem 20: Algebra perspective or group of equations, but not individual equation.
* Chapter 7: solution (basis) lives in the null space. The number of BASIS means dimention of the null space.
* Chapter 7: KCL: just add the current (or minus if opposite direction)
* Maybe I should allow a few empty box in the github contribution. Busy day with full of meetings happens. I should not influence or bother by a little green box. It might good for show off or HR but not really good for me. If you really want a full year green, write a program and submit empty content every day.  

#Typo and error in textbook
* Chapter 7
  * 7-2: 11, 15, 29
  * 7-3: 19
  * 7-7: 3 (Example 2 but not theorem 2)
  * 7.9: 10. First column is 3x1, can not multiply with 3x1 vector. if the elements multiply with the vector elements accordingly, then rank=5.
* Chapter 8
  * 8.2 - 7, the answer forget to work out the limit.
  * 8.2 - 15: I got a different result. Need to cross-check
  * 8.3 - 1: Answer is wrong
  * 8.4 - 1: A typo in the question. The second A lacks a hat. For the answer, I would simplify it to [-1, 2]^T. Not a mistake.

# Watch out
* **Always check your result**
* Check Matrix Size
* Basic arithmetic calculation. Write them down.
* Careful on the terminology. E.g: Solution sets means 0, 1, or infinity. It does not mean a basis set. or a solution.
* **Think from the new view**. Linear Algebra deal with a GROUP of equations, instead on individual.
