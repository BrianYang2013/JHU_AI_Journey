# About this repo
I plan to publish my solutions and exercise here. It will not include the quiz and exam since they belong to the school.

Plan to do my best to reduce the silly mistakes:
* Cross-check the result with my classmates,  
* Check the odd-number answers in the textbook appendix,
* Double-check if I get enough time to avoid silly mistakes,

I will be glad to receive any suggestions and feedback to continually improve it.

# About this course
This course mainly covers Linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and complex analysis.
Better to warm up with calculus 1 and 2.

Textbook: [Advanced Engineering Mathematics, 10th Edition](http://webpages.iust.ac.ir/jazbi/books/10Edition-ErwinKreyszig-AdvancedEngineeringMathematics.pdf)

This will be the most difficult course for me, due to language, terminology, education system, and lack of the mathematic training in the past 20 years. As long as I can conquer this one, I think I should be able to handle all of the rest. Never underestimate the top school.
