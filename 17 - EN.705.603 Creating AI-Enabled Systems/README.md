Course Objectives

- System Thinking
- Machine learning life-cycle
- Technologies + Resources
- Real-world Systems. 

Motivation

- Maximize value of ML models
- Improve research skills
- Implementation over theory
- Financial incentives

ML systems VS software systems

- Data vs Code, Model vs Algorithm, Iteration and experimentation vs Testing and debugging
- Probabilistic vs Deterministic, Adaptability vs Fixed logic, 
- Model evaluation vs Functional Test, Data dependence vs Code dependence. 
- Model deployment vs Software deployment, Monitoring and continuous vs Maintenance, Learning. 

When to use ML

- Capacity to learn, Patterns are complex, Data exists, Predictability, Similar distribution in production and training data, Tasks are repetitive, Consequence of errors is low, Tasks are scalable.
