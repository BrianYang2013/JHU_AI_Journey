# About this repo
I plan to publish my solutions and exercise here. It will not include the quiz and exam since they belong to the school.

Although I plan to cross-check the result with my classmate,  check with the odd-number answers with the appendix, and double-check if I get enough time to avoid silly mistakes, I can not guarantee all of them are correct. I will be glad to receive any suggestions and feedback to continually improve it.

# About this course
It mainly cover Linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and complex analysis.
Better to warm up the calculus 1 and 2.
