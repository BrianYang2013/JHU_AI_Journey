# Check-in

- 7-10 hours per week. Idearly 15 hours: 2 hours per day. 
- 50+ pages per week. 25+ per day. 
- Take days off to focus on study if needed (before Lab, middle, final)
- Skim through exercises, width > depth (for a introduction course)

# Tips

- Points for understanding. So write down the detail, show the notation. 
- Start from the definition, follow the formula. Sometimes the distribution is not as you assume, it might be complex. 
- While using the mathematic tools, validate the result. In some cases it might not process well. 
- Friday flowers, bagel, coffee (rather than beer)
- Netflix: Picture a scientist.

# Notes

2021-08-31 W01 Reflect:

- What is the pro and cons of each measurment? Why we need them? Apply to which scenarios? 

2021-09-19 W03 Reflect:

- I found an interesting problem in the quiz, wasted a lot of time, and successfully annoyed the grader. Log it down and post it as an article. A good probability questions with coincidence solutions. 
- My second attempt came with some mistakes.A few because of my careless, and a few I should adjust later. Don't expect a improvement in the best score, so basically waste 2 hours. Maybe not worth the time, especially since this semester is very demanding. Allocate the time in a smart way. 

2021-10-14 Mid Reflect

- Harvard cheatsheet is a good summary. 
- Not sensitive to the notation. Practice the math notation during W7-W14 PE practice. Write it down and check. 
  - Population: Greek character, gods know them
  - Sample: lower case
- Add the link of notation here. 
- Add Midterm formula and notation

2021-10-25 Hypothesis Testing

- Important topic! Create template for test procedure
- Z test / T test / P-value. Beta, estimate n. 
- [Interesting article from Regina Nuzzo](https://www.nature.com/articles/506150a)
- Mid term: 99. add unit to the mu (even the temp result? ), and round up for final result (not accept one digital decimal)
