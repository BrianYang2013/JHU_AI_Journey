# AI journey in JHU
Artificial Intelligence, Master of Science @ JHU Whiting School of Engineering.
From June 1st 2021

## Why this repo
* Record, reflection, improvement(iteration, epoch...)
* Provide a reference for people who are exploring a similar area. 

## Before you pick up a program, think about it:
* Master or PhD, Engineering or MBA, Full-time or part-time
* Alternative choice
  * If you want to start in DS/ML/AI area, go [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) etc.
  * If you want to apply DS/ML/AI to your job, go for the packages such as [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#), [Xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or search repo in Github. 
  * If you want to know more about SOTA, go to Github, conference such as ACL, ICML, NIPS, AAAI, IJCAI, ICCV, CVPR, KDD..., or Arxiv
  * If you want to take one course, you can find a lot of open resources available online. Some good courses can be found in the reference resource session. 
* Misc: US degree, finance, time. 

## Goals 
* Math - Understand and awareness. Build the foundation for the future. 
* Coding - Improve the technical expertise. Algorithms, packages, framework etc.
* Academic training - Learn about how to discover better knowledge, understand where good taste and standards are, question my knowledge system to support my continuous learning and improvement in the future.

## Journey of applying the schools
* 2018: Plan for my DS master application. It was interrupted by an international assignment. 
* 2020: Back to the bay area, resume my application
* School selection: [CSRankings - AI](http://csrankings.org/#/index?ai&vision&mlmining&nlp&ir&us)
* Program type: online + master degree
* TOEFL: 
  * Sept 2020: 29/29/23/25. UCLA requires 21/17/24/25, and UW requires all 25+. Focus on speaking
  * Oct 2020: xx/xx/25/21. Sad. Focus on writing. Last try
  * Nov 2020: xx/xx/23/27. Ok, maybe I do not belong to UCLA and UW. 
* Application
  * Painful to get all documents verified, especially government and [WES, world education services](https://www.wes.org). WES issue me a wrong course-to-course evaluation report in the first place and then leave a major issue in the correction report. After the second report, they insist 72 < 71, and there is nothing they can do about it. Probably, that is life. 
  * 3 applications, 3 offer. 
  * School 1 is great, but focus on engineering perspective. This might not be the best area I am looking for. 
  * School 2 is great, but one of my friends just enrolled. Maybe I can try something different and diversify the experience. 
  * JHU seems one of the most rigorous program I can find. I Choose You! (Quote from PokÃ©mon)
* JHU
  * Provisional admission in DS program @ Jan 2021
  * Interesting to see the breakthrough in the mathematic, such as [Deep Networks from First Principles](https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Deep_Networks_from_First_Principles.pdf), and [Geometric Deep Learning,  Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478), So I switch to the AI program @ May 2021
  * Start in June. 

## Before the semester start
* Q1 2021: Stablize the current working envirnoment, and secure resource
  * Full time work: 50% of work will focus on ML/AI projects, and no over-time work in the next 3 years. 
  * Personal Time: Secure 20:00-23:00 PM for study. One weekend (well...) 
  * Financial part. 
* March 2021: [Python 3 Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming). Brush up my python skill. Finish in 4-5 weeks maybe. 
* March 2021: [Precalculus through Data and Modelling Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/precalculus-data-modelling). Familar with the math term in English, and refresh my high school math. Finish in 1 week. 
* April 2021: [Calculus I with Precalculus: A One-Year Course](https://www.amazon.com/Calculus-I-Precalculus-One-Year-Course-dp-0618568069/dp/0618568069/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1621531863). I just happens to have this book. The US text books organized in a logical way and easy to follow. Love it. Finished. 
* May 2021: [Khan: Multivariable calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus). In progress
* May 2021: [Advanced Engineering Mathematics, 10th Edition](http://webpages.iust.ac.ir/jazbi/books/10Edition-ErwinKreyszig-AdvancedEngineeringMathematics.pdf), or you can find it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Engineering-Mathematics-Erwin-Kreyszig/dp/0470458364/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=advanced+engineering+mathematics&qid=1621532850&s=books&sr=1-1), pretty expensive. In progress
## Pre-requisites courses
Although I might exempt from some of them, I don't think I still remember them after 20 years. Plan to take as much pre-requisites courses as possible. 
* Multivariable and Complex Analysis
* Linear Algebra
* Statistics and Probability
* Data Structure
