# AI journey @ JHU
Artificial Intelligence, Master of Science @ JHU Whiting School of Engineering.
From 2021 summer

## Why this repo
* Plan, do, check: record/analysis/reflection, improvement (or so called iteration)
* Provide a reference for people who are interested.

## Think before action
* Master or PhD, Engineering or MBA, Full-time or part-time
* Which area to pick? DS: insights. ML: forecasts. AI: actions. Reference: [What's the difference between data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence?](http://varianceexplained.org/r/ds-ml-ai/)
* Alternative choice
  * If you want to start in DS/ML/AI area, go [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) etc.
  * If you are going to apply DS/ML/AI to your job, go for the packages such as [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#), [Xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or search repo in Github.
  * If you are aiming to re-produce SOTA, go to Github, conferences such as ACL, ICML, NIPS, AAAI, IJCAI, ICCV, CVPR, KDD..., or Arxiv
  * If you want to take one course, you can find a lot of open resources available online. Some good courses examples can be found at the reference resource session.
* Misc: US degree, finance, time, risk and opportunity cost.
* Read this: [Why AI is Harder Than We Think](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12871.pdf)

## Goals
* AGI(Artificial General Intelligence) is not likely to happen in my generation. But if something interesting comes up, I wish I can understand it.
* Personal interests
  * Math
    * Awareness
    * Lay the foundation. Meanwhile, I should be able to understand math in a reasonable timeframe (GTM level, 3 months?)
  * Coding - Improve the technical expertise. Properly need to practice every day.
    * You don't know what you don't know.
    * Copy, applying, innovate.
  * Engineering - I am not too worry about this part.
  * Academic Training - I should be able to discover and pick up the knowledge, be aware of where good taste and standards are, and restructure my knowledge system to support my future improvement.
* General Goals (keep collecting)
  * Program - Finish it
  * Program - Finish with shortest possible timeframe (not for me)
  * GPA - I heard there is something called straight A.
  * Academy - Research project, or leave your name on a paper (cool!)
  * Network - Join some interesting group
  * Career - Find a job (I already got one), startup
  * Community - Record my journey which might help others.  

## Journey of applying the schools
* 2018: Plan for my DS master application. It was interrupted by 2018 APAC international assignment.
* 2020: Back to the bay area, resume my application
* School selection: [CSRankings - AI](http://csrankings.org/#/index?ai&vision&mlmining&nlp&ir&us). Most of the CS departments only open full-time program.
* TOEFL:
  * Sept 2020: 29/29/23/25. UCLA CS 21/17/24/25, and UW CS all 25+. Focus on speaking
  * Oct 2020: xx/xx/25/21. Focus on writing.
  * Nov 2020: xx/xx/23/27. Maybe I do not belong to UCLA and UW. Move on.
* Application
  * It took me 4-5 months to get all documents verified by government and organization. [WES(world education services)](https://www.wes.org) issues me a wrong course-to-course evaluation report in the first place and then leave an obvious issue in the second correction report. After that, they insist something like 2 < 1 and refuse to take any further amendment. Probably, that is life.
  * 3 applications, 3 offers. JHU seems one of the most rigorous programs I can find. I Choose You! (Quote from Pokémon)
* JHU
  * Provisional admission in DS program @ Jan 2021. Spent Q1 and Q2 on my organization transformation.
  * Interesting to see the breakthrough in mathematic, such as [Deep Networks from First Principles](https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Deep_Networks_from_First_Principles.pdf), and [Geometric Deep Learning,  Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478). So I switch to the AI program @ May 2021

## Before the first semester
* Don’t overestimate strategically, and underestimate tactically.
* Q1 2021: Stabilize the current working environment and secure resource
  * Full-time work: Starting Q3, 50% of my time will focus on ML/AI projects.
  * Personal Time: Secure 20:00-23:00 PM for my study. One weekend (well...we will see)
  * Financial preparation. Company sponsor etc.
* March 2021: [Python 3 Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming). Brush up my python skill.
* March 2021: [Precalculus through Data and Modelling Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/precalculus-data-modelling). Familiar with the math terminology in English, and refresh my high school math.
* April 2021: [Calculus I with Precalculus: A One-Year Course](https://www.amazon.com/Calculus-I-Precalculus-One-Year-Course-dp-0618568069/dp/0618568069/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1621531863). I happen to have this book. The US textbook organized logically with a good learning curve. Easy to follow, love it.
* May 2021: [Khan: Multivariable calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus). Finished [Derivatives of multivariable functions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives), not easy to get 100%
* May 2021: [Advanced Engineering Mathematics, 10th Edition](http://webpages.iust.ac.ir/jazbi/books/10Edition-ErwinKreyszig-AdvancedEngineeringMathematics.pdf), or you can find it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Engineering-Mathematics-Erwin-Kreyszig/dp/0470458364/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=advanced+engineering+mathematics&qid=1621532850&s=books&sr=1-1), Pre-read a few chapters.  
## Pre-requisites courses
No matter what you scored 20 years ago, they won't leave too much trace on you. From this perspective, I am not so mad at WES and plan to take as many pre-courses as possible:
* 625.250 - Multivariable Calculus and Complex Analysis
* 625.252 - Linear Algebra and Its Applications
* 625.240 - Introduction to Probability and Statistics
* 605.202 - Data Structures

### Tools:
  * [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - Maintain this repo
  * [Atom](https://atom.io/) - Markdown editor
  * [markdown-preview-enhanced](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced) - Plugin, for markdown preview and Latex
  *  iPad - Recommend for reading the textbooks. It is astonishing to know that a public textbook(in PDF) list \$900+ on Amazon as new, while \$600+ (acceptable) or \$200 (good) as second hand. Obviously there is something wrong in the US academic publication system.
