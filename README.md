# AI journey in JHU
Artificial Intelligence, Master of Science @ JHU Whiting School of Engineering

## Why this repo
* Record, reflection, improvement(iteration, epoch...)
* Provide a reference for people who is exploring the similar area. 

## Before you pick up a program, think about it
* Master or PhD, Engineering or MBA, Full time or Part time
* Alternative choice
  * If you want to start in DS/ML/AI area, go [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) etc.
  * If you want to apply DS/ML/AI to your job, go for the packages such as [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#), [Xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or search repo in github. 
  * If you want to know more about SOTA, go Github, Arxiv, or conference such as ACL, ICML, NIPS, AAAI, IJCAI, ICCV, CVPR, KDD...
  * If you want to take an interesting course, you can find a lot of open resource such as [CS229: Machine Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/), [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), [EECS 208: Computational Principles for High-dimensional Data Analysis](https://book-wright-ma.github.io/Book-WM-20210422.pdf), [CS 285: Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_iWQOsE6TfURIIhCrlt-wj9ByIVpbfGc), [DS-GA 1008: Deep Learning](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/)...
* Misc: US degree, finance, time. 

## Goals 
* Math - Understanding and awareness 
* Coding - Improve the technical expertise. Algorithms, packages, framework... 
* Academic training - Learn about how to discover better knowledge, understand where good taste and standards are, question my knowledge system to support my continuous learning and improvement in the future.

### Tips
* Start early 
* Secure Resource
  * Daily work: 50% company work will focus on ML/AI projects
  * Time: Secure 20:00-23:00 PM for study. One weekend (well...) 
  * Finance
* GPA

## Journey of applying the schools
* 2018: Plan for my DS master application. It was interrupted by an international assignment. 
* 2020: Back to the bay area, resume my application
* School selection: [CSRankings - AI](http://csrankings.org/#/index?ai&vision&mlmining&nlp&ir&us)
* Program type: online + master degree
* TOEFL: 
  * Sept 2020: 29/29/23/25. UCLA requires 21/17/24/25, and UW requires all 25+. Focus on speaking
  * Oct 2020: xx/xx/25/21. Sad. Focus on writing. Last try
  * Nov 2020: xx/xx/23/27. Ok, maybe I do not belongs to UCLA and UW. 
* Application
  * Painful to get all documents verified, especially government and [WES, world education services](https://www.wes.org). WES issue me a wrong course-to-course evaluation report in the first place and then leave a major issue in the correction report. After the second report, they insist 72 < 71, and there is nothing they can do about it. Probably, that is life. 
  * 3 applications, 3 offer. 
  * School 1 is great, but focus on the engineering and project. This might not the best I am looking for. 
  * School 2 is great, but one of my friend just joined. Maybe I can try something different and diversify the experience. 
  * JHU seems one of the most rigorous program I can find. I Choose You! (Quote from PokÃ©mon)
* JHU
  * Enrolled in DS program. 
  * Interesting to see the breakthrough in the mathematic, such as [Deep Networks from First Principles](https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Deep_Networks_from_First_Principles.pdf). So I switch to the AI program.
