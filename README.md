# AI journey in JHU
Artificial Intelligence, Master of Science @ JHU Whiting School of Engineering.
From June 1st 2021

## Why this repo
* Record, reflection, improvement(iteration, epoch...)
* Provide a reference for people who are interested in this topic.

## Before you pick up a program, think about it:
* Master or PhD, Engineering or MBA, Full-time or part-time
* DS: insights. ML: forecasts. AI: actions. reference: [What's the difference between data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence?](http://varianceexplained.org/r/ds-ml-ai/)
* Alternative choice
  * If you want to start in DS/ML/AI area, go [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) etc.
  * If you are going to apply DS/ML/AI to your job, go for the packages such as [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#), [Xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or search repo in Github.
  * If you are aiming to re-produce SOTA, go to Github, conferences such as ACL, ICML, NIPS, AAAI, IJCAI, ICCV, CVPR, KDD..., or Arxiv
  * If you want to take one course, you can find a lot of open resources available online. Some good courses can be found in the reference resource session.
* Misc: US degree, finance, time, risk and Opportunity Cost.
* Read this: [Why AI is Harder Than We Think](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12871.pdf)

## Goals
* Math - Understanding and awareness.
* Coding - Improve the technical expertise. Algorithms, packages, framework etc.
* Academic training - Learn about how to discover better knowledge, understand where good taste and standards are, question my knowledge system to support my continuous learning and improvement in the future.

## Journey of applying the schools
* 2018: Plan for my DS master application. It was interrupted by an international assignment.
* 2020: Back to the bay area, resume my application
* School selection: [CSRankings - AI](http://csrankings.org/#/index?ai&vision&mlmining&nlp&ir&us)
* Program type: online + master degree
* TOEFL:
  * Sept 2020: 29/29/23/25. UCLA requires 21/17/24/25, and UW requires all 25+. Focus on speaking
  * Oct 2020: xx/xx/25/21. Sad. Focus on writing. Last try
  * Nov 2020: xx/xx/23/27. Ok, maybe I do not belong to UCLA and UW.
* Application
  * Painful to get all documents verified, especially government and [WES, world education services](https://www.wes.org). WES issue me a wrong course-to-course evaluation report in the first place and then leave a major issue in the correction report. After the second report, they insist 72 < 71, and there is nothing they can do about it. Probably, that is life.
  * 3 applications, 3 offers.
  * School 1: more focus on the engineering perspective. This might not be the best area I am looking for.
  * School 2: one of my friends just enrolled. Maybe I can try something different and diversify the experience.
  * JHU seems one of the most rigorous programs I can find. I Choose You! (Quote from PokÃ©mon)
* JHU
  * Provisional admission in DS program @ Jan 2021
  * Interesting to see the breakthrough in mathematic, such as [Deep Networks from First Principles](https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Deep_Networks_from_First_Principles.pdf), and [Geometric Deep Learning,  Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478). Considering I have worked 15 years in  data analytic, maybe I take one more step for my next 15 years. So I switch to the AI program @ May 2021
  * Start in June.

## Before the first semester
* Q1 2021: Stabilize the current working environment and secure resource
  * Full-time work: After Q2, 50% of work will focus on ML/AI projects.
  * Personal Time: Secure 20:00-23:00 PM for study. One weekend (well...we will see)
  * Financial preparation. Company sponsor etc.
* March 2021: [Python 3 Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming). Brush up my python skill. Finish in about 4-5 weeks.
* March 2021: [Precalculus through Data and Modelling Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/precalculus-data-modelling). Familiar with the math term in English, and refresh my high school math. Finish in about 1 week.
* April 2021: [Calculus I with Precalculus: A One-Year Course](https://www.amazon.com/Calculus-I-Precalculus-One-Year-Course-dp-0618568069/dp/0618568069/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1621531863). I just happen to have this book. The US textbook organized logically with a good learning curve. Easy to follow, love it. Finished in about 2-3 weeks.
* In progress - May 2021: [Khan: Multivariable calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus).
* In progress - May 2021: [Advanced Engineering Mathematics, 10th Edition](http://webpages.iust.ac.ir/jazbi/books/10Edition-ErwinKreyszig-AdvancedEngineeringMathematics.pdf), or you can find it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Engineering-Mathematics-Erwin-Kreyszig/dp/0470458364/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=advanced+engineering+mathematics&qid=1621532850&s=books&sr=1-1), pretty expensive.
## Pre-requisites courses
Although I might exempt from some of them, I don't think I still remember them after 20 years. Plan to take as many as possible.
* Multivariable and Complex Analysis
* Linear Algebra
* Statistics and Probability
* Data Structure
