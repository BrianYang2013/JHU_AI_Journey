# AI journey in JHU
Artificial Intelligence, Master of Science @ JHU

## Application
* 2018: Plan for my DS master application. It was interrupted by an international assignment. 
* 2020: Back to the bay area, resume my application
* School selection: [CSRankings - AI](http://csrankings.org/#/index?ai&vision&mlmining&nlp&ir&us)
* Program type: online + master degree
* TOEFL: 
  * Sept 2020: 29/29/23/25. UCLA requires 21/17/24/25, and UW requires all 25+. Focus on speaking
  * Oct 2020: xx/xx/25/21. Sad. Focus on writing. Last try
  * Nov 2020: xx/xx/23/27. Ok, maybe I do not belongs to UCLA and UW. 
* Application
  * Painful to get all documents verified, especially government and [WES, world education services](https://www.wes.org). WES issue me a wrong course-to-course evaluation report in the first place and then leave a major issue in the correction report. After the second report, they insist 72 < 71, and there is nothing they can do about it. Probably, that is life. 
  * 3 applications, 3 offer. 
  * School 1 is great, but focus on the engineering and project. This might not the best I am looking for. 
  * School 2 is great, but one of my friend just joined. Maybe I can try something different and diversify the experience. 
  * JHU seems one of the most rigorous program I can find. I Choose You! (Quote from PokÃ©mon)
* JHU
  * Enrolled in DS program. 
  * Interesting to see the breakthrough in the mathematic, such as [Deep Networks from First Principles](https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Deep_Networks_from_First_Principles.pdf). So I switch to the AI program.
