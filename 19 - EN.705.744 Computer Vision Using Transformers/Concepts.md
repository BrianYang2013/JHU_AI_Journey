**Embedding Algorithm**: 

- Convert discrete data, such as words, into continuous vectors of fixed dimensions. These vectors, known as embeddings, capture semantic information about the words. In the Transformer, embeddings are applied to both the input tokens (words) and the position information, creating word embeddings and positional embeddings.
