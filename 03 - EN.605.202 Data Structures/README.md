# About this course

Textbook: zyBooks, Optional textbooks. 

Refresh course in FA21 term. It seems very demanding. 

# Approach

- Focus on logic. No library (except IO and math). 
- Understand the problem and the benefits gained in selecting a particular strategy or tools. Focus on the trade offs. Consider Pro and cons among many different factors, such as: 
  - Programming environment
  - Time constraints
  - Existing code
  - Personal preferences
- Consider forming a study group. 

- Spread your effort out over the week. Coding every day. 

- [Feynman Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_Technique)
  - **Concept**: Choose the subject to study
  - **Explain**: Pretend to explain it to a child
  - **Fill**: Fill in gaps in understanding exposed in step 2 by returning to the sources
  - **Simplify**: Simplify the explanation
- Discussion: Critical thinking

## Check-in 

- 10-15 hours per week. Idearly 25 hours: 2 hours per weekday, 8 hours per weekend. 
- Coding everyday
- Take days off to focus on study if needed (before Lab, middle, final)
- Always add new features to your lab work. Finish all requirement will get 90%, extra will get 100%, new feature get extra 2 points. 
- Always incude URL, pictures in the post. Always. 

## Survive tips

- zyBooks. Read the homework but not start it. Lecture. Office Hour on Thruday night. HW. Quizzes (but not the last day)
  - Don't start HW before the Thursday office hour. The interpretation of the problems will always surprise you. 
- Use source version control: It will save your project and lab, at least once. 
- Quiz: Blackboard might slow, if too many students doing the quiz at the last day. 
- Lab: All module 5 will focus on Labs
- Resource: Check out the programming resources. Helpful. Some code allow some not (due to languages)
- Discuss: Repost Module 2 and 3: Posts before the module start WILL be deleted. It confuse people because Module 2 discussion post stats that it is based on Module 1. 
- Discussion: If you have to re-post it, add the URL and a disclaimer. To avoid plagiarism
- Discuss: 4 posts over three days per week. 
- General: Everyday you got some surprise. Keep a note and move on. 
- Compile Python: 
  - Folder , relative path. 
  - Use module. 
  - Use relative path. 
  - Input from the command line.

# Notes

2021-08-31 W01 Reflect:

- The quiz-0 come with lots of details. System gives 2 attemps but the second one slightly worse than the first. Well, need more focus and better preparation.  
- Sept-02, first office hour. Now I know why we have 3 office hours. Maybe I should plan 30 hours per week on this course. 

2021-09-08 W02 Reflect: Turns into the ruthless scoring machine mode. Just focus on the points. LOL

- Secure the baisc points, zyBooks, discussion
  - Make sure sync the zyBooks, I heard Java group encountered issue on sync. 
  - Post 3 days with 4 posts per week. High quality posts may include references, quotes, links, or diagrams or images
  
- Get points on Homework, Quiz
  - This course is not well organized. 
  - Think from the teacher view. Some quizzes does not make sense in the real world but make sense as a course. Focus on the criteria and get the score. 
  - Separate the knowledge, study, and passing the course. They are different. 
  - We already get experiment for fun in the week 1.Now its time for score. 
  
- Prepare for the lab, start as early as possible. 

- All activities get recorded. Scott knows that I start honor pledge 2 weeks before the course. 


2021-09-14 W03 Reflect

- For W02, I think I spent 10 hours per weekend and most of the night, so 30+ hours. 
- Surprise to see I get full credit from the HW1. After some fun testing which waste a few points, now I am above median on all category now. 
- Haven't start lab yet, need to catch up. It will due on Module 5 but some early work can start now. 
- 9/19, finished everything in W03. Cool, I catch up with the schedule. I need to start lab 0 and lab 1. 
- From the lecture, I can see our professor really really love recursion. She spent half of the video talking about 2 real recursion languages. So when I was taking the ugly multiply words selection problem, I started with some reasonable results. But I decided to spend my last 5 minutes double-checking the lecture and what she saidâ€”a strange choice of the words, but Bingo, no issues. 

# Areas to improve

- Hard to use blackboard. 
- Can not delete post
- No real time collaboration
- Course can better organized. 
  - All reference materials should put together. 
  - Too many type of different works, homework/quiz/book/optional book/discussion, which confuse people. 
  - If we do need to cover all of them, there should be a check list to help setup the routine and remind us. 
  - The learning curve might want to improve. For example, the homework comes with limited background and it is not clear to most of the students. 
  - zyBooks, I picked python and found lots of Java or c type pseudo code.
