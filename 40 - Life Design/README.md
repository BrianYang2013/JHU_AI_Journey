### Imaging your future self

- **In 10 years, I want to live in a world where…**
- We discover possibilities by **doing** (“Test & Learn”) and **“flirting”** with our future selves. (Epstein& Ibarra)
- What careers you have considered if that path was no longer an option  
- As a kid, what you imagined you would be “when you grew up” 
- What your family wanted you to be “when you grew up” 
- What you told an admissions officer you wanted to do after college 
- What you tell recruiters and interviewers now 
- What you have imagined doing if you won the lottery (Endless resource)
- What you would do if it weren’t for peer or familial pressure 
- Jobs you’ve heard about from friends or on social media and thought: “Wow, that job sounds kind of cool” 

Imagine yourself in each of your lives, looking back on this moment (and all prior moments). 

- What seeds of that future life have you already planted? Thinking of becoming a doctor?  
- What have you already accomplished that will make it possible?  Want to write a book?  What have you read, seen, heard, or experienced that will make it possible to write it?   Want to be a computer engineer, an investment banker, a data analyst, or a biomedical engineer?  What from your past and present is already laying the foundation for those lives?
  You already have pieces of your future story in place, because the self you will become is based – in part – on what you have experienced until now. 

### Link with your valuee

- In what ways do these imagined lives align with or support the values you articulated in your Workview and Worldview?
- How might your values change or transform in the process of becoming the lives that you imagined?
- In what ways do your imagined lives contribute to the world in which you hope to live?

### Fill with detail

- Do you work at a specific company in mind? Do you have a specific title or specific set of job responsibilities?
- Where do you live? Where do you Work?
- What about family? Do you have a partner/spouse? Kids? (or maybe you do)
- What do you do outside of work? Hobbies? Interests? Volunteer work?
- Which activities from college do you continue to pursue or leave behind?
- By 2031, what was your most significant accomplishment in this life?
- Once done, give each imagined life a 4-6 word title and write it on top of the page.

### Polish

- Can you imagine ways in which they might be combined?
- Are there ways in which your imagined lives seem so fundamentally different that choosing one means fully letting go of the others?
- Are there imagined lives that are so foreign to your current experiences/worldview that it is hard to imagine the person you might become should you go down that path?
- How might you design your way forward with these tensions, challenges, contradictions, and opportunities in mind?
