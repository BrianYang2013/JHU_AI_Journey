## Check List

- [x] Everyday: respond to email (give detail information, reduce misunderstanding)
- [x] Everyday: Check Canvas on Announcements, Posts, etc.
- [x] Everyday: Check Team and "Like" every post from professor, as acknowledge that we have read it
- [x] Monday: Module Open: 
  - [x] Review Self-Check (do the algorithm by hand), PA (implementation)
  - [x] Watch Lectures (Videos), extra reading materials. 
  - [x] Read Textbook


- [x] Wednesday: Office Hours
- [x] Thursday night: **Submit** Self-Check in PDF in Canvas, (complete or incomplete)
- [x] Early Friday: **Post** self-check questions in discussion group.  
- [x] Middle Sunday: Group self check comments (discuss conceptually). Review at least two other self-checks and post comments. Start with fewest responses so far. Respond to ALL questions(?).
- [x] Sunday: Assessment, 10 questions this week, 5 random from previous. 45mins, Randomized. Can not go back. => Do it as early as you can. The programming not help assessment, but assessment might help programming. 
- [x] Sundays: PA: Submit notebook: <JHED ID>.ipynb
- [x] Mindmap

## **Programming Assignments**

- In functional style: Functional Programming approach constructs programs by building up small easily testable *pure* functions into a domain specific language (DSL) for the problem at hand called by *impure* functions at the edges of the program.
  - Functions are first class values, independent of Classes or Types.
  - Data modeling with generic data structures: lists, sets, dictionaries, tuples instead of Classes.
  - Operations such as iteration are replaced with higher level oft repeated abstractions such as map, filter and reduce.
- Office hour 1
  - Basic python structures. 
  - Functional, take arguments and return arguments. 
  - Documentation: clear, follow template, ID, name, function, description, the theory behind (A* requries a heuristic)
  - Implemenation: better with annotation, optional. 
  - 3 unit tests - corner cases ... assert. 
  - **Only the requested output is acceptable.** 
  - Under 20 lines
- Professor will: answer all questions, prior to submission, about the algorithm
- Grade criteria:
  - Conform to the course programming requirements
  - Provide the requested output correctly
- A: 9-10

# Notes

2022-06-01: Office hour

- Take one course at at time. Two courses for full time students. 
- No late. No external resources. No google. 



# Tips

- Focus on logic. No library (except IO and math). 
- Understand the problem and the benefits gained in selecting a particular strategy or tools. Focus on the trade offs. Consider Pro and cons among many different factors, such as: 
  - Programming environment
  - Time constraints
  - Existing code
  - Personal preferences
- [Feynman Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_Technique)
  - **Concept**: Choose the subject to study
  - **Explain**: Pretend to explain it to a child
  - **Fill**: Fill in gaps in understanding exposed in step 2 by returning to the sources
  - **Simplify**: Simplify the explanation
- Discussion: Critical thinking
