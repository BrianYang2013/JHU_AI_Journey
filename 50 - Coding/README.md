# About this repo - Coding

It might be a good idea to read and practice code every day, books or Leetcode.
Time frame: 2-3 years, through my AI program

Need to warm up and practice:
* Python, ML packages and framework.
* Java, Industry
* C++, Performance and CV (Put in the list)
* Data Structure
* Algorithms / Leetcode / Algorithms analysis
* ML/AI algorithms
* Packages: Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn...
* DL tools: Pytorch, Tensorflow
