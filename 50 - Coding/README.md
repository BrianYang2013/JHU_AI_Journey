# About this repo - Coding

It might be a good idea to read and practice code every day, books or Leetcode.
Time frame: 2-3 years, through my AI program

Need to warm up and practice: 
* Python, ML packages and framework. 
* Java, Industry
* C++, Performance and CV (Put in the list)
* Data Structure
* Algorithms
* ML/AI algorithms
* Packages: Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn... 
* DL tools: Pytorch, Tensorflow

# Resource
## Reference Repo
* A great repo with full of wheels: [Python Algorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python)

## Language
* [UM: Python 3 Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming) - Already warmed up. [Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/5eb92fd864116d2271c467b1b05b2e17)
* [Duke: Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming#courses)

## Data Structure
* [UCSD: Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms)

## Algorithms
* [Stanford: Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)
* [Princeton: Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1#syllabus)
* [Princeton: Algorithms, Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2#syllabus)

## Books
* Stage 1: Warm up the general coding skill. Casual reading material:
  * [我的第一本算法书 / アルゴリズム図鑑](https://www.ituring.com.cn/book/2464)，a fun book to refresh the basic knowledge.
  * Grokking Algorithms
* Stage 2: Go through the primary algorithms. Just familar with the standard solutions. Backlog:
  * Data Structures and Algorithms in Python 1st Edition by Michael T. Goodrich ...
* Stage 3: Here comes some practice and the main course. Backlog:
  * Python Programming in Context 3rd Edition - Textbook
  * Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition (The MIT Press), by Thomas H. Cormen - Textbook
* Stage 4: Not sure whether I should step into the algorithms analysis, maybe just move on to the ML and DL packages and frameworks.
