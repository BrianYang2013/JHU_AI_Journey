# About this repo - Coding

It might be a good idea to read and practice code every day, books or Leetcode.
Time frame: 2-3 years.

* Stage 1: Warm up the general coding skill. Working in progress:
  * [我的第一本算法书 / アルゴリズム図鑑](https://www.ituring.com.cn/book/2464)，a fun book to refresh the basic knowledge.
  * Grokking Algorithms
* Stage 2: Go through the primary algorithms. Just familar with the standard solutions. Backlog:
  * Data Structures and Algorithms in Python 1st Edition by Michael T. Goodrich ...
* Stage 3: Here comes some practice and the main course. Backlog:
  * Python Programming in Context 3rd Edition - Textbook
  * Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition (The MIT Press), by Thomas H. Cormen - Textbook
* Stage 4: Not sure whether I should step into the algorithms analysis, maybe just move on to the ML and DL packages and frameworks.
