About this course



# Approach

- Focus on logic. No library (except IO and math). 
- Understand the problem and the benefits gained in selecting a particular strategy or tools. Focus on the trade offs. Consider Pro and cons among many different factors, such as: 
  - Programming environment
  - Time constraints
  - Existing code
  - Personal preferences
- Consider forming a study group. 

- Spread your effort out over the week. Coding every day. 

- [Feynman Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_Technique)
  - **Concept**: Choose the subject to study
  - **Explain**: Pretend to explain it to a child
  - **Fill**: Fill in gaps in understanding exposed in step 2 by returning to the sources
  - **Simplify**: Simplify the explanation
- Discussion: Critical thinking
