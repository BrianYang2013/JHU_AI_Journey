About this course

# Textbook

- Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Ed., T. H. Cormen, C. E. Leiserson, R. L. Rivest and C. Stein, McGraw Hill [ISBN 978-0-262-03384-8]

# Approach

- Focus on logic. No library (except IO and math). 
- Understand the problem and the benefits gained in selecting a particular strategy or tools. Focus on the trade offs. Consider Pro and cons among many different factors, such as: 
  - Programming environment
  - Time constraints
  - Existing code
  - Personal preferences
- Consider forming a study group. 

- Spread your effort out over the week. Coding every day. 

- [Feynman Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_Technique)
  - **Concept**: Choose the subject to study
  - **Explain**: Pretend to explain it to a child
  - **Fill**: Fill in gaps in understanding exposed in step 2 by returning to the sources
  - **Simplify**: Simplify the explanation
- Discussion: Critical thinking

1. [Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/) developed by NIST. In addition to information about algorithms you can also get information about asymptotic families such as [little-o notation](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/littleOnotation.html)
2. [Wolfram MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/) is an excellent source to look up concepts used in this course. Since it is a curated and reviewed site, you can rely on the material being correct. You might, for example, look up MAXIMUM clique and MAXIMAL clique on this site.
