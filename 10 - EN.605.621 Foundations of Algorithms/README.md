# *Approach*

- *Focus on logic. No library (except IO and math).* 
- *Understand the problem and the benefits gained in selecting a particular strategy or tools. Focus on the trade offs. Consider Pro and cons among many different factors, such as:* 
  - *Programming environment*
  - *Time constraints*
  - *Existing code*
  - *Personal preferences*
- *Consider forming a study group.* 

- *Spread your effort out over the week. Coding every day.* 

- *[Feynman Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_Technique)*
  - ***Concept**: Choose the subject to study*
  - ***Explain**: Pretend to explain it to a child*
  - ***Fill**: Fill in gaps in understanding exposed in step 2 by returning to the sources*
  - ***Simplify**: Simplify the explanation*
- *Discussion: Critical thinking*
