### Analysis of Algorithms

- The theoretical study of computer-program performance and resource usage
- What's more important than performance?
  - Correctness
  - Functinality
  - Maintainability
  - Robustness
  - Extensibility
  - Programmer Time
  - Simplicity
  - Modularity
  - Realiability

### Why study algorithms and performance?

- Algorithms help us to udnerstand **scalability**
- Perfomance often draws the line between what is feasible and what is impossible
- Algorithmic mathematics provides a **language** for talking about program behavior
- Performance is the **currency** of computing
- The lessons of program performance generalize to other computing resources
- Speed is fun!
