# About this repo - Coding

Goals: 

- Warm up my data structure and algorithms knowledge.
- Get familar with the tools

Approach

- Read and practice as much as possible. 
- Don't invent the wheels. Understand and use it. 

Time frame: 

- 2-3 years, through my AI program.
- Time for space (breadth and depth)

Languages

* Python: ML packages and framework.=> Key
* Java: Industry. Backend. Container. Andriod. => Simple, focus on data structure and algorithm
* C++, Performance and CV. Backend. 

Data Structure and Algorithms

* Data Structure
* Algorithms: General, Leetcode, Algorithms analysis
* Algorithms: ML/AI
* Packages: Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn...
* Tools: Pytorch, Tensorflow... 

# Journey

21W28 - July 11 to July 17

- Setup environment

- Tools for data structure and general algorithms:
  
  - Purpose: 
    
    - Simple - Friendly to new programmer
    
    - Light - Focus on algorithm and logic
    
    - Easy to debug, trace performance etc
  
  - IDE (debug) > TextEditor (light). Or specifically, VScode > IntelliJ IDEA > Sublime
  
  - Java > Python. Python is too "Advance", due to list, dict and string operation etc. And it does not specify the variable type.

- Bug free

# Resource

## Tools and environment

* IDE: VScode. Simple, Light, Easy. 
  * Alternative: IntelliJ IDEA. Versatile, heavy for entry level. Community version is good enough, Premium is free for students, you can apply [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) 
* Markdown: [Mark Text](https://github.com/marktext/marktext), light, export PDF, support LATEX. 
  - A few bugs: with LATEX, and automatically generate new line which can not delte. 
  * Alternative: Atom + plugin(Markdown Preview Enhanced): Latex + export PDF. 
  * Alternative: Typora
* Anaconda. Always a good choice
* TextEditor:
  - Sublime Text. Reference: [How to compile and run a Java program with Sublime Text 3](https://www.codejava.net/coding/how-to-compile-and-run-a-java-program-with-sublime-text-3). 
  - TextMate. Light. For Markdown preview: Ctrl + Option + Command + p. [Markdown Redcarpet](https://github.com/streeter/markdown-redcarpet.tmbundle) might work for github markdown. The ruby version is too old, may get some trouble.
