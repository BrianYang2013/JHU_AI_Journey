# About this repo - Coding

I have no intention to become a full-time programmer. Still, it will be beneficial if I can warm up my data structure and algorithms knowledge. To achieve my purpose, I do not intend to invent the wheel but familiar with many kinds of wheels.
Specifically, I don't plan to write my code but read, learn, replicate and run what available on the Internet. All copyright(if any) goes to the original author. 

Time frame: 2-3 years, through my AI program. 

Scope

* Python: ML packages and framework.
* Java: Industry. Backend. Container. Andriod.
* C++, Performance and CV. Backend. 
* Data Structure
* Algorithms / Leetcode / Algorithms analysis
* ML/AI algorithms
* Packages: Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn...
* DL tools: Pytorch, Tensorflow

# Journey

21W28 - July 11 to July 17

- Setup environment

- Tools for data structure and general algorithms:
  
  - Purpose: 
    
    - Simple - Friendly to new programmer
    
    - Light - Focus on algorithm and logic
    
    - Easy to debug, trace performance etc
  
  - IDE (debug) > TextEditor (light). Or specifically, VScode > IntelliJ IDEA > Sublime
  
  - Java > Python. Python is too "Advance", due to list, dict and string operation etc. And it does not specify the variable type.

- Bug free

# Resource

## Tools and environment

* IDE: VScode. Simple, Light, Easy. 
  * Alternative: IntelliJ IDEA. Versatile, heavy for entry level. Community version is good enough, Premium is free for students, you can apply [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) 
* Markdown: [Mark Text](https://github.com/marktext/marktext), light, export PDF, support LATEX
  * Alternative: Atom + plugin(Markdown Preview Enhanced): Latex + export PDF. 
  * Alternative: Typora
* Anaconda. Always a good choice
* TextEditor:
  - Sublime Text. Reference: [How to compile and run a Java program with Sublime Text 3](https://www.codejava.net/coding/how-to-compile-and-run-a-java-program-with-sublime-text-3). 
  - TextMate. Light. For Markdown preview: Ctrl + Option + Command + p. [Markdown Redcarpet](https://github.com/streeter/markdown-redcarpet.tmbundle) might work for github markdown. The ruby version is too old, may get some trouble.
