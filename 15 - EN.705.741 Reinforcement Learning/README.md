# Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs): 

- Model sequential decision problems as **Markov decision processes** and apply appropriate reinforcement learning methods to solve them.

- Understand the impacts of **key design issues and tradeoffs** and make sound selections for different problem spaces.
- Predict the **effect** of design choices on algorithm **stability** and **convergence** properties.
- Efficiently adjust learning algorithm parameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor) to achieve the best **performance** against real-world problems.
- Follow developments in the reinforcement learning **research literature** and skillfully apply new algorithms as appropriate.
